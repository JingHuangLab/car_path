**All folders are named according to the reaction numbers (rxn@{number}) in the Baker set.**

Baker set [Journal of Computational Chemistry, Vol. 17, No. 7, 888-904 (1996)] 
is a convinent set of reactions for testing MEP algorithms. Here we performed 
CAR and CI-CAR MEP calculations on all closed shell systems in the Baker set.

rxn1 : HCN -> HNC 
rxn3 : H2CO -> H2 + CO
rxn9 : Diels-Aider reaction of Cyclohexene
rxn10: s-tetrazine -> 2HCN + N2
rxn11: butadiene rotation
rxn12: C2H6  -> C2H4 + H2
rxn13: C2H5F -> C2H4 + HF
rxn14: vinyl alcohol -> acetaldehyde
rxn15: HCOCl -> HCl + CO
rxn16: H2O + PO3(-) -> H3PO4(-)
rxn17: CH2CHCH2-O-CHCH2 -> CH2CHCH2CH2CHO
rxn18: SiH2 + CH3CH3 -> SiH3CH2CH3
rxn19: HNCCS -> HNC + CS
rxn20: HCONH3(+) -> NH4(+) + CO
rxn21: acrolein rotation
rxn22: HCONHOH -> HCOHNHO
rxn23: HNC + H2 -> H2CNH
rxn24: H2CNH -> HCNH2
rxn25: HCNH2 -> HCN + H2

Convergence is based on path energy change of 0.07 kcal/mol (a very coarse one).
